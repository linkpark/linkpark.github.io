  <p>Policy gradient theorem is the basis of many deep reinforcement learning methods (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347">PPO</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477">TRPO</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290">SAC</a>). Meanwhile, Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is one of the popular generative methods in machine learning. Since the target problems of these approaches share the same formulation, we can use policy gradient as an alternative training method for VAE.</p>
