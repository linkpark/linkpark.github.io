I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Exeter. I have also spent half a year in London at the Alan Turing Institute as an [enrichment student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/jin-wang). My research interest includes cloud and edge computing, learning-based system optimisation, reinforcement learning, and applied machine learning. 

I received both of my B.S. and M.S. from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), majored in Computer Science. 

Here are some of my recent publications:
